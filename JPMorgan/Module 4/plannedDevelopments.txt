Unfortunately, due to a heavy school workload at the time of upload, I am unable to enact the changes I was planning on completing.

Upon inspection of the JPMorgan Perspective repository, here are the changes I identified and planned on making:
 - Dark mode toggle
 - Fixing the X and Y axis labels such that they don't overlap dense data labels
 - Having on-page sliders and text fields to resize the perspective frame and adjust the speed of data query
