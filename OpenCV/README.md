# OpenCV
These are tutorials I have followed from [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)

* 001 - [Face detection with OpenCV and deep learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/)
    * OpenCV's built in deep learning face detector
    * `python detect_faces_video.py`
* 002 - [OpenCV Tutorial: A Guide to Learn OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/19/opencv-tutorial-a-guide-to-learn-opencv/)
    * General tips and tricks regarding OpenCV
    * `python opencv_tutorial_01.py`
    * `python opencv_tutorial_02.py`
* 003 - [How to Build a Kick-Ass Mobile Document Scanner in Just 5 Minutes](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/09/01/build-kick-ass-mobile-document-scanner-just-5-minutes/)
    * Detect edges, corners, and perspective transform rectangles to get a top down view of the document
    * `python scan.py --image images/receipt.jpg`
* 004 - [Bubble sheet multiple choice scanner and test grader using OMR, Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/03/bubble-sheet-multiple-choice-scanner-and-test-grader-using-omr-python-and-opencv/)

* 006 - [Measuring size of objects in an image with OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/03/28/measuring-size-of-objects-in-an-image-with-opencv/)
    * Uses a reference object (leftmost object in the frame) to measure sizes of distances between objects
    * `python object_size.py --image images/example_01.png --width 0.955`
    * `python object_size.py --image images/example_02.png --width 0.955`
    * `python object_size.py --image images/example_03.png --width 3.5`
* 007 - []()
