Welcome to Module 4, Model Training
with Azure Machine Learning Service. In this module, we're going to discuss
the Azure Machine Learning Service. We're going to create a use
an Azure Machine Learning Workspace. I'm going to show you how to
do that programmatically. I'm going to show you how to
do that via the command line. And we're going to show you how to
do that graphically in the port. We're then going to show you how
to train your own model using the Azure Machine Learning Service. And define and
configure available computer resources for use in model training in Azure. And then we're going to recall how to
set up an experiment, execute a run. And access a model in
the Azure Machine Learning Service.
