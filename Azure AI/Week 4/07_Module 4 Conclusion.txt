In summary, in Module 4, we discussed the Azure
Machine Learning service, and how you interact with it. We taught you how
to create and use the Azure Machine
Learning service with az command line tool, and the portal, as well
as programmatically. We showed you how to
train your own model using the Azure Machine
Learning Service. We covered how to define available computer resources
for model training. We also showed you how to
separate an experiment, execute a run and access a model of the Azure Machine Learning Service
when you're done. The next chapter is going
to show you how to take that registered model and deploy it as web
servers in the cloud.
