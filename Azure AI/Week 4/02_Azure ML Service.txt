So what is the Azure ML service? It's an end-to-end
machine learning service available on Azure, helps data scientist automate the machine learning life-cycle. You start locally and then train and deploy the cloud you need to, if you do decide to deploy
in the Cloud and auto-scales and necessary resources for
training and deployment, and it provides a Python SDK. So what are the steps to
access the Azure ML resources? You start by creating
a workspace, then you Create
and Train a model, you pick your best model, you register it
with the workspace, and then you use the
registered model and scoring scripts to deploy Azure
Container instances, Kubernetes services or an
IOT end point as well. What we're going to cover in this chapter is
creating a workspace, and how to implement their resources to create
and Train a model. So what is a workspace?
It's a centralized place of reference for all
of your ML resources, it keeps history of
training and runs, lets you setup User Roles
to share and collaborate, and lets you define
different Compute Targets to run your experiments. Experiments are how you
automate the process, to build your models. So let's go ahead
and look at a demo of how to create an ML workspace.
