In this video we're going to
discuss the project lead tasks. We're going to show you how
to create a project repo. We're going to see the project repo
from the team projects template. And then we're going to get
a little bit more into DevOps and create a feature work item and
then stories for project phases. And then of course one other step if you
have a multi-personnel team is to set up security controls and provide access. Here I am in my Azure DevOps interface,
and this is my lqaicourse organization. And previously we've demonstrated
in other videos how to create a group common team, and
then how to create an LQDevOps team. The first step for the project
lead is to create a project repo. Let's go ahead into LQDevOps team project. Let's click on Repos. Under LQTeamUtilities let's
click on New repository. The type is going to be Git. And let's go ahead and
create an LQDataScience repo. And if I come over here and click on
Repositories and Manage repositories. This we've got an LQDataScienceProject1,
we've got an LQTeamTemplate, and we've got an LQTeamUtilities. Now let's go ahead and input the team
template into your project repository. Here's our LQTeamTemplate. Let's go ahead and
clone our repository name. Come back over here to our repos. Hoover our DataScienceProject1. Click on Import Repository. Here's the URL we're going to clone. And we're going to click on requires
authentication, we're going to enter the username, we're going to enter
the password that we just copied. So let's change our default Agile approach
in DevOps to a team data science template. In my lqaicourse organization I'm
going to click on organization settings. I'm going to come down here and
click on Boards and Process. Notice how we created an Agile
data science process under the Agile default reference,
and let's click this. Under epic the click on,
let's click on Disable. This also disable features,
user stories, and tasks. Now let's select the Backlog level tab and
enter Epochs, click on Edit, and rename. Yeah, let's name this TDSP Projects. Under the new work item also put
TDSP Projects, and click Add. And then make sure that
the TDSP Projects is checked. And under the default workout and type
click on TDSP Projects, and click on Save. Do the same thing for Features. Features is now disabled. Click on Edit and rename. We're going to change this to TDSP Stages. going to add a new work item type. And we're going to add
business understanding, and we're going to add data acquisition. And we're going to add modeling,
and we're going to add deployment. Click on Save. We're going to rename
stories to TDSP Substages, add a new work item, click on Add. And set the default work item
type type to TDSP Substages. And finally under Iteration Backlogging,
click on Edit, add a new work item type. It's going to be TDSP Task,
and click on Add. And set it to the default work item type. So under blacklog levels notice
we've got TDSP Projects, got TDSP Stages, got TDSP Substages,
and we got Tasks. The next step is to create a project
based on this new template. So back here in our organization,
let's click on new project. Our project name is going to
be LQDataScienceProject. Under Advanced let's click on our Agile
data science process, and click on Create. Here on our first project, let's now
click on Boards, let's click on Backlogs. And we're going to click
the on the TDSP Projects to define backlogs, and
click on Save and Close. So let's click on TDSP Projects. Let's click on New Work Item, and let's
click on Project1, and add to the top. And then to add a work item
we're going to do a plus and click on Business and Understanding. Here's one example of a backlog
with high level tasks, substages, and tasks actually assigned.
