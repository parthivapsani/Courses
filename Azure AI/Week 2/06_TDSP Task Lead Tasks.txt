Welcome to the video
that discusses team lead tasks and the
team data science process. The first step we're
going to do is create a team project individual DevOps, we're going to rename some
of our team repositories, we're going to create
a team template repo, we'll import the
group utilities and templates and the
appropriate team repos, and if needed to, we would
set up security as well. Let's go over to
our browser window, and you can see I've got
the front landing page for my LQ AI course
DevOps organization. The next thing we need to
do is click a new project. I'm going to name
this my LQDevOpsTeam, and the description
we're going to put is my awesome DevOps team,
and under advanced. Our version control is
going to be a git and our work item process
is going to be agile and let's click on Create. So under the DevOps team
project that we just created, let's click on repos
because the second step is to rename our default
repository to seem utilities. Just click on repos. Let's click on
Manage Repositories. Right-click my LQDevOps team and click on Rename Repository, and we're going to name
our repository name LQTeamUtilities. The next step is to create
our team template repository. I'm going to click
on new repository, the type of repository is git. The repository name can be LQTeamTemplate, and let's create. I refresh the page and notice under my Manager
repository and I've got an LQ team template
and the LQ utility. Now, we're going to go
to our team template. The next step is to import the contents of the group common that we created earlier. Over here on the right-hand
side let's click on repos, and notice my default LQ
team template comes up, and it tells me that
it's currently empty. So here I have my
LQ team template. Let's import our group
project template into this new team set
of repositories. So we're going to click Import. Here's our URL, https://dev.azure.com/lqaicourse/GroupCommon/_git/ GroupProjectTemplate
and let's click Import. This particular error comes up. Import request cannot be processed to what are
the following reasons. It turns out we need
a git authorization. So let's close this. Let's come back over here to
my Azure DevOps. Let's go in a group
common, script our repos. Here in my group project
template notice I have a clone button over here
on the right-hand side. Let's click on clone, and let's generate git
credentials right here. This will solve that
error that we got, and let's copy this password. So we comeback over here,
we got our files and repos, click on requires authentication, click on your username, and then paste this git
credential password that you got from
the previous screen. Let's click on input. Let's do the same thing for
our utilities repo. Click on repos. Click on LQ team utilities. Let's click on import
repository and go to git utilities. Click on clone. Copy the URL that
we're going to clone. Paste it into our clone URL. Click on requires authentication. Back over here in
the group utilities, generate git credentials, and copy the password,
username and password. Once I have my
repositories configured, let's click on our overview
of our DevOps team. Click on the gear. Click on Teams. Click on our LQ DevOps team and add whatever users or groups
you need to here. You can also click
on permissions. You've got build admins,
contributors, endpoint admins, project administrators,
project validators, we've got readers, and then we've got the default
project team as well. In summary, our team lead tasks including creating a
project in Azure DevOps, renaming the team repository
to TeamUtilities, created a TeamTemplate, importing the GroupUtilities
and templates, and then setting up security.
