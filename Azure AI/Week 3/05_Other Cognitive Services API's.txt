In addition to cognitive
services Vision API, the other APIs we have
include language, speech, search and decision. As you can see here,
the language API includes text
analytics, translation, spellcheck, a question
and answer tool, language understanding
and an Immersive Reader. The Speech API includes
speech to text, text to speech,
speech translation and a new speaker recognition
capability as well. The search API, this time Microsoft includes
Spellcheck, Visual Search, Entity Search, New
Search, Autosuggest, Web Search, Video Search, a Custom Search and a Local Business
Search as you can see. The decision API includes
a content moderator, a Personalizer and
an Anomaly Detector. These tests we're using any cognitive APIs
very similar to these tests were used
for computer vision. There's all sorts of
front ends to try it out. So we're going to cognitive
services and pick the particular tool
you want to use. We're going to create
a cognitive services API from the Azure portal. We're going to
reference the API Keys on the Quickstart page of the API and call it either on the command line or programmatically as
we've shown you before. Once again here's the high
level APIs to include visions, speech, search,
language and decision.
