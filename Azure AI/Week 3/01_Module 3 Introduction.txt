Hello and welcome to Module 3. In this module, we're going to cover the Cognitive Services APIs that are provided
by Microsoft and Azure. So we're going to look at and play at random
what's Computer Vision, the Language API, Search API, the Speech API, and the
Decision API as well. Recall when you first scope and Ai project
you're going to decide whether we're going to build your own dedicated Machine
Learning model or whether you're going to use a pre-canned,
pre-trained version. That's what Azure Cognitive
Services provides. It allows developers to add Machine Learning
features into their applications without much direct AI or data
science knowledge.
