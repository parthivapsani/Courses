In conclusion, we've covered Microsoft's Cognitive
API services to include the vision API, the language API, the search API, the speech API, and
the decision API. We've shown you the resources of how to explore
each of these APIs. We've shown you how to create cognitive API resources on Azure and I was showing you how to call the created API using the subscription keys
and the endpoint from both the command line and in an implemented
Python example. Remember in the bigger picture, this is a choice you have as
your scoping an AI project. So you can either use a pre-configured model which
are the examples we're using here or in the next chapters we're going to talk about how you build and train your own model, and then deploy it to
use it in practice.
