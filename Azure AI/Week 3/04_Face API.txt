So let's create and play around with Face this in the Face API. So here I am and creating
a new resource in Azure. Let's click on AI and
Machine Learning. Let's click on Face. We're going to name it RJ's Face API. The deployment is underway. The deployment is successful. Let's go ahead and
go to the Resource. Let's go ahead and copy our keys. Here's an example of the
implementation of the Face API. Just like we've done before
in the last two examples, we're going to import requests. We're going to specify
the new sub-key. We're going to save the base URL and include a
slash detect at the end of it. If I run this
particular shell note, it comes back and
gives me the string of the face API to make
sure we've got it right. We've got our image URL. If we click on this one, you notice that there
this guy right here. So we're going to implement our Subscription Key
in a set of headers. The parameters that API is requesting is
the return face ID, the return face landmarks, the return face attributes. This will go in age,
gender, head pose, smile, facial hair, glasses,
and motion, makeup. We've got to request that post. We're going to take our Face API that includes the slash detect. We're going to take our
parameters that we're sending to the API. We're encapsulating our
Subscription Key in our header, and then the JSON, in this case, is going to be a key of URL and the image URL that
we're sending it. We're going to send
a response.JSON and pprint the results. If we click on this, goes
back with the age of 62, comes back with this
emotion of happiness, comes back with no
facial hair 0.1. Gender is male, he's
not wearing glasses. See that the head pose, pitch, roll and yaw, eye makeup is false and
lip makeup is false. Smile is one. Here's the particular face ID and the face rectangle
that comes back.
