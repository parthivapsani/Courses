Hello everyone. My name
is Ronald J Daskevich. Not only I'm going to
be introducing to you our definitions
have of AI chapter. Once you complete this chapter, you'll be able to define
AI and Machine Learning. We'll be able to
explain some common Machine Learning
tasks and algorithms. You'll be able to
describe some languages used in Data Science. We're going to use some
basic Python commands, and then describe the
Python scientific ecosystem that's built on top of it. We're going to explore
some open-source resources for solving Machine
Learning problems.
