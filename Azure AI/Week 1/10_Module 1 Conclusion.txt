Welcome to our summary of AI definitions. In this course we defined artificial
intelligence as the simulation of human intelligence in computers. We also defined the ideas
of machine learning, Where the machines mimic
the way that humans learn. We also explain some common
machine learning tasks and algorithms such as supervised and
unsupervised machine learning, And classification and regression in addition. We described some of the common
languages used in data science. The main ones being Python and R. And then we delve down into some
basic Python to show you how we're going to interface with that
language in this particular course. We described the Python Scientific
Ecosystem to include NumPy and Pandas and the graphing capabilities in Matplotlib. And we introduced you to the development
environments of Visual Studio code, And Jupyter Notebooks. We also introduced you to some open
source resources for solving machine learning problems and implemented some
solutions in Scikit-learn as well as describing the details of other libraries
that are available such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and Matplotlib and
most recently Keras as well.
