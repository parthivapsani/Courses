Welcome, everyone. In this video,
we're going to cover some Python basics. Python is high level. It's interpreted. It's free and open source. It supports structured, functional,
and object-oriented programming. It's loosely typed. It runs on all of the popular
operating systems. It's important remember than indexing
starts at 0, like C and C plus plus. And indentation is important when
you send code to the editor. Here are some of the basic data
types that are included in Python. You can see here, we've got an int,
we've got a float. We've got a complex. We've got a Boolean,
and we've got a string. I suggest that you please review
the demo on Python variables. That will show you a few more details. Here's the basic Python
collections we have. To include a list, we've got a set. we've got the idea of a tuple and we've
got the idea of dictionaries as well. Packages are public repositories
that contain libraries. Libraries contain modules
that incorporate function. And if you need to use one
input them before they're used. And usually that happens
to the top of the file. Here are a couple of examples.
