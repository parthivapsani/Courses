Looking to module five. Module deployment with Azure ML Service. The objectives of this module is to
demonstrate how to connect to an existing workspace programmatically. We're then going to explain how to
reference a model trained in the cloud. Based on previous training
that you've done. We're going to describe the steps
to deploy a model in the cloud. We're going to implement a scoring script. And finally, we're going to learn
how to understand how to deploy and test a model of registered in Azure.
